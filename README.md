# Flex

Reproduce the template using the FLEX properties. The template must contain :
- 1 header with a main title
- 1 navigation menu with a title and 5 links (like the course example)
- 1 aside on each side
- 1 central container with 3 top-aligned text fields
- 1 footer taking up the entire page footer
  
A few additional tips and tricks :
- The template takes up the entire height and width of your display.
- Try as much as possible to use the flex property for children, I only needed to specify a size in 2 places.
- When you reduce the width of the page, when there's no more room in the middle paragraphs, new lines are created.
- Margins and classic positioning are not permitted. Margins are used for aesthetic purposes only.
